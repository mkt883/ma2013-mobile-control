# BUGS

# Phone app
There is a bug with the call app. If you're in it and click the notification for it the ringtone plays over the call.

Not too sure on how to fix it.

Also I struggled to get the phone ringing to stay on loop so it just plays once

# Scrolly
Sometimes the infinite scroll does not infinite scroll. Not too sure why
